# DataBase-Design-With-Oracle-SQL-Data-Modeler
Database Design:
I created a database model using Oracle SQL Data Modeler, drawing inspiration from the structure and features of the https://www.ritchiefeed.com/ website. 
The model includes identifying entities, establishing relationships, defining attributes, implementing keys, normalizing the data, creating tables, applying constraints, defining indexes, and generating SQL scripts for database creation.
